  a hopeful vision of what you want to achieve, and develop a clear mission from
  that.

## üéØ Invitation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Inspiration" %}
This is a unifying exercise for people to start understanding their personal connection to this work. Essentially it asks ‚Äòwhy are we all here?‚Äô&#x20;

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Aim" %}
The purpose of this exercise is to create a hopeful vision that everyone in a group can aim for. This helps clearly define shared terms and language and can be used as a compass going forward.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Do" %}
The exercise can be done online or in real life. If online, the Miro board below can be used for harvesting individual strands and creating a shared vision.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## üëÄ Overview

1. Lead the group through a guided visualisation to the year 2050 (2030 or any other horizon can be used if preferred).&#x20;
2. Invite them to share what they saw and felt during the visualisation and to record that on a Miro board.
3. The group then discusses what came up and clusters the responses around themes.

## ‚úè Activity: Vision Script

This is a script to lead a group through a guided visualisation to the future we want. Please adapt the language to suit your narration style and context.
