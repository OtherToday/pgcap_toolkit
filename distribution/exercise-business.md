Businesses have a huge impact on our world. By doing this exercise you can begin to understand the many ways that this can happen. Your projects will be richer and more dimensional with an understanding of the impact that a venture can achieve.

### What do we mean by business impact?

The effect that a business has on the world

We can understand this through the idea of impact on [People, Planet, Profit](../direction/people-planet-profit.md)

1. **People:** How you employ people, how your business activity affects a community. How the business is owned - employee-owned?
2. ** Planet: **The environmental impact of your manufacturing or other business activities such as transport. Planting trees, carbon or biodiversity offsetting.
3. **Profit:** Do you keep the money or share the money?

## &#x20;üëÄOverview: Simplified Business Model Canvas

![Screenshot from Miro board](<../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png>)

A **Business Model Canvas** helps you focus on your vision and break down how to achieve it, on a single clear page.

This simplified layout (the original was by [Osterwalder and Pigneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business\_Model\_Canvas)), gives you a bird‚Äôs eye view of your activity to spark new ideas from a different perspective. It also enables collaborative discussions by helping to set out the key elements and showing how everything interrelates, particularly when related to social and environmental impact.

The Miro board contains one example and one blank canvas. Go through the example with the group until the basic concepts are grasped, then divide the group into threes and give each group a task to fill in the canvas for a particular company.&#x20;

A further stage can be added where students fill in the canvas for their current project.
