## :dart: **Invitation**

In Distributed Design, your documentation may be the first thing someone sees when they encounter your project. If you want your work to be replicated, improved and adapted to new contexts, you need to consider how to invite people in; how to tell the story of your design; and what technical information you need to provide to  help them distribute it.

In pandemic conditions, this work is both more urgent, and more challenging. With Andrew, we look at some ways to get started.

## üì∑ Inspiration
####  Who is Andrew Sleigh?
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OtherToday/pgcap_toolkit/main/.gitbook/assets/DSC03179-sm.jpeg)

Andrew Sleigh is a designer and maker working in Brighton, UK. He is passionate about sharing your work; without sharing, your project just exists on a desk in your studio.

He advocates building the documentation process into the design process as a form of reflective design process.&#x20;

**His top tip:** write notes, and take photos and videos as you work so you have all the assets you need when you want to share it.

[Andrew's personal website](https://andrewsleigh.com)

## Purpose
Documentation tells the story of why your product is interesting and gives others something to share further.

In traditional product or industrial design, the documentation is often left to others, for instance, the manufacturer.  In Distributed Design, it is important that these assets are owned by the designer.&#x20;

We want consumers/ citizens to choose Distributed Designs over mass-produced products. Great photography and clear and easy-to-follow instructions enhance this desirability.

The purpose of this section of the toolkit is

* To understand why documentation is so important in Distributed Design
* To learn some tools and tips for creating great documentation
* To apply them to a project of your own


## To Do
1. Read this section top to bottom first
2. Watch the three videos
3. Create your own documentation!


## ‚úèActivity: Product Photography

### Part 1

In groups research the key words in this Miro board. Be prepared to teach your peers about the terms.

![Miro Board](https://github.com/OtherToday/pgcap_toolkit/blob/main/.gitbook/assets/Screenshot%202021-10-31%207.04.00%20PM.png?raw=true)[Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lmtI5rg=?invite_link_id=894671888078)

### Part 2

These three videos are designed to provide an introduction to product photography for absolute beginners. By experimenting with household items, we find ways of staging and lighting products to get pretty good results without spending any money.

There are also some ideas on how to take your lighting to the next level. Once you've mastered the basics, you'll be in a much better position to know where to invest money, or what you need to focus on to improve.

## Andrew's Plotter Project

![](https://i.imgur.com/wkWbHKi.png)
[Plotter](https://andrewsleigh.com/plotter)

This pen plotter was designed to be a replicable project, distributed through DIY maker communities. By documenting the project in a variety of ways, from technical (BOMs, 3D CAD files) to non-technical (videos, motivations) Andrew was able to realise more value from the project and have greater impact than working alone. \

## üìù Making and Prototyping Resources for Designers

How can design students (in my case, product design students) make their work without access to university facilities such as workshops, fablabs, simulation suites, computer labs and technical support.

We want them to make artefacts to test assumptions, validate with users, and communicate ideas, but they now have very limited access to the facilities, teaching formats and technical support they would normally get.

Here is a list of useful resources, approaches, case studies, tools, methodologies, tutorials, software, etc. e.g.



* Free (to students) software for design, prototyping, simulation and visualisation
* Prototyping methodologies and links to tutorials, videos, online learning where these things are demonstrated - e.g. paper prototyping UIs
* Creative use of media to share or test ideas
* Case studies to show this being done well
* Great examples of project documentation, lo-fi prototypes, design films etc.

Headings of topics to cover, or links to specific resources are all useful.
