‚ÄòHello, I‚Äôm Ryan. Erm ‚Ä¶ all these things are linked somehow, but at times the associations may be a bit loose.‚Äô Ryan Gander

{% endembed %}

This activity is called Loose Associations, inspired by a lecture series by the artist Ryan Gander. You are invited to prepare a Pecha Kucha that is researched by following divergent hyperlinked tangents. This is a distributed approach to research - a rhizomatic way of exploring in order to help you discover interests and insights.&#x20;

## ‚úè Activity

In this brief you will be exploring and expanding your subject field and identifying a line of inquiry that is individual to you delivered as a Pecha Kucha. A Pecha Kucha is a storytelling format, invented by designers Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham in 2003. A presenter shows 20 slides for 20 seconds of commentary each (6 minutes and 40 seconds total).

This is not a PowerPoint presentation! You will construct this talk through links between images and the stories behind them. It is very important that this talk is personal to you and that you find it genuinly interesting - it is not an academic talk. This is creative research.

‚ÄãThe research should be conducted as if you have got lost in Wikipedia; each hyperlink taking you to another interesting thing. The aim of this research is to discover things you do not know about!

{% tab title="Tips" %}


* Your starting image should be something (or someone) you are interested in, know or care about



* Don't worry about the presentation yet, enjoy researching. Online or in the library.&#x20;

‚Äã

* Keep the jumps in topic small
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Task" %}




* Create your slideshow using some film editing software (e.g. imovie or adobe premier) Each image needs to be on screen for 20 seconds while you talk about it.

‚Äã

* For each slide write 30 words telling us what is interesting about this image

‚Äã

* Your first image doesn't need to be the thing you started with

{% tab title="Example" %}
In many ways the Chupa Chups lollipop, invented in 1958, is a bona-fide design classic. The logo, eye catchingly placed on top was designed by the surrealist artist Salvidor Dali. If you look really closely at the moth in this Silence of the Lambs poster you can see Dali's skull. These moths are called Deaths Head Moths and have what look like skulls on them.

Humans have made these moths change colour. The peppered moth used to be white but pollution has caused the surfaces it lands on to go black. Now it has evolved to blend in with soot rather than lichen...
