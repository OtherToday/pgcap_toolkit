# „Ä∞ Brief: One Sheet

## &#x20;**üéØ Invitation**

### **Using one sheet of material, design a product to be as simple, cost-effective and waste efficient as possible.**

> ‚ÄúThe environmental impact of shipping includes air pollution, water pollution, acoustic, and oil pollution. Ships are responsible for more than 18 percent of some air pollutants.‚Äù Schrooten L, De Vlieger I, Panis LI, Chiffi C, Pastori E (December 2009).&#x20;

This brief is about experimenting with forms, techniques and materials and considers the global supply chain as a resource. Laser cutters, CNC's, sewing machines and inkjet printers are all made to accept standard sheet materials available globally. Instead of shipping bulky, complex products around the world, can we hijack existing material flows (of raw and waste materials), utilise locally available fabrication methods and design products that could be made anywhere by anyone?

## &#x20;‚úè Activity

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Material" %}
The object should be made out of one, standard sized sheet, that is commonly available and compatible with appropriate machinery. You can make (or grow) this sheet yourself, find it or purchase it but you will need to account for its origin and display the waste (if any) alongside it. NO MDF and avoid international shipping (Amazon). Consider the restrictions we are under due to covid - where & what can you make? What materials can you source in spite of compromised supply chains (there is a world-wide acrylic shortage for example)

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Fixings" %}


In addition to your sheet you can use appropriate fixings and components like wires, light bulbs, bolts and bands. (Consider disassembly and end of life - screws, bolts and push fit is preferred to glue)

{% tab title="Scale" %}
Your object when disassembled should fit through a standard uk letter box - 254mm x 38mm

{% tab title="Make" %}
Try multiple and diverse techniques and ideas before you settle on one. You could create a tool for cutting, punching or bending. You could create a material to go in a cnc or laser cutter. You could create a template for sewing or a recipe for a sheet. Whichever you choose you must document it and it must be repeatable, evidenced by instructions.

Map out the final supply chain of your object annotating impact on **people, planet and profit.** Track where your sheet and fixings are from, and consider the end of life of your object. Display this next to your object.
