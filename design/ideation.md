# „Ä∞ Ideation

## üéØ Invitation

This page is about generating ideas with or without a brief. Sometimes to just get started you might need an idea to jumpstart creativity. The activity in the Miro board is a random number generator paired with two 'rulers' of materials and methods. The technique is inspired by Victor Papenek and Arthur Koestler's writing on 'bisociation'
